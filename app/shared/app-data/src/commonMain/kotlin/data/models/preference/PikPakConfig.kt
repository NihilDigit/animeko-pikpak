/**
 * User-configurable settings for the PikPak offline-download backend.
 *
 * The engine runs a server-side slot cache: completed offline tasks stay in a
 * well-known working folder on the user's PikPak drive, keyed by source
 * bucket, so replays of the same magnet are served straight from the cache.
 * Old buckets are evicted to honor [slotQueueLength] — they are *not* deleted
 * immediately after each resolve. See `PikPakOfflineDownloadEngine` for the
 * full eviction policy.
 *
 * [refreshToken] is written by the engine after a successful signin/refresh
 * (not user-editable). It lets the next app launch skip the rate-limited
 * `/v1/auth/signin` endpoint and go straight to a cheap refresh.
 *
 * [password] is accepted from the settings UI to bootstrap the first signin,
 * but the engine clears it from this config once a refresh token has been
 * obtained — so the password is not persisted to disk across app restarts. If
 * the refresh token later becomes invalid, the UI will ask for the password
 * again.
